# Couses taught by Associate Prof. Yan Li
Taught on-campus at [SPU](http://en.sspu.edu.cn/2018/) and maintained to be friendly to online students (both English and Chinese).

# Welcome to my classes at [NEOLMS](http://liyanonline.neolms.com). To access each class the access codes are required:

* Operations  Management: IISH-AEGZ

* Management: FNLH-BPWX

* Operational Research: QOPZ-KSMU

* Business Intelligence: XZPT-APZG


#### Manifesto:
* __Optimize for the curious.__ For all the materials that aren’t covered in detail there are links to more information and related materials (D.Silver/Sutton/blogs/whatever). Assignments will have bonus sections if you want to dig deeper.
* __Practicality first.__ Everything essential to solving reinforcement learning problems is worth mentioning. We won't shun away from covering tricks and heuristics. For every major idea there should be a lab that makes you to “feel” it on a practical problem.
* __Git-course.__ Know a way to make the course better? Noticed a typo in a formula? Found a useful link? Made the code more readable? Made a version for alternative framework? You're awesome! [Pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) it!

* Magical button that launches you into course environment: 
    * [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/master) - comes will all libraries pre-installed. May be down time to time.
    * If it's down, try [__google colab__](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [__azure notebooks__](http://notebooks.azure.com/). Those last longer, but they will require you to run installer commands (see ./Dockerfile).
